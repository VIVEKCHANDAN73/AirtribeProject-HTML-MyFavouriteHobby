            "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert T. Kiyosaki contrasts the financial philosophies of the author’s two fathers: his real father (Poor Dad), who was highly educated but financially struggling, and his best friend’s father (Rich Dad), who lacked formal education but was financially successful. The book emphasizes the importance of financial literacy, investing, and entrepreneurship over traditional employment. Kiyosaki highlights the difference between assets and liabilities and advocates for acquiring assets that generate passive income. It encourages readers to think differently about money and to pursue financial independence.
